## Java Programming Basics

### Comments
Comments are parts of the program that are ignored when the program is run. They are useful for making notes for yourself that explain what's happening in the code. If others are reading your code, comments are especially important to help them understand your thought process. Comments are also useful for trying things in your code without loosing the original attempt.

```java
// This is a comment on one line

/* This is a comment that
spans several lines
of code */
```

Single line comments can be very useful to add a comment to the end of some code, like this:

```java
background(255); // set the window background to white
```

Multi-line comments can be very useful for writing longer comments at the beginning of sketches, which can be very helpful when you come back to some code you've written previously, like this:

```java
/*
This is an example of a sketch that uses Processing to generate complex patterns with very little code.
*/
```
